<h1>HBD: A 3D Semantic Reconstruction-oriented Image Dataset for Building Component Segmentation</h1>


We launch **EVA**, a vision-centric foundation model to **E**xplore the limits of **V**isual representation at sc**A**le using only publicly accessible data and academic resources. **EVA** is a vanilla ViT pre-trained to reconstruct the masked out image-text aligned vision features (*i.e.*, CLIP features) conditioned on visible image patches. Via this pretext task, we can efficiently scale up EVA to one billion parameters, and sets new records on a broad range of representative vision downstream tasks.

***EVA is the first open-sourced billion-scale vision foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a broad range of downstream tasks.***
