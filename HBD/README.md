## Introduction

</div>

The HBD (Hong Kong University Building Image Dataset) dataset contains 3,378 images collected from both interiors 
(2,235 images) and exteriors (1,143 images) of 36 buildings with different architectural styles (29 modern and 7 historical) 
and various space types (e.g., office, classroom, lab, study area, canteen, and pantry) on the campus of The University of Hong Kong. 
The dataset was precisely annotated with 11 common building component types on the object instance level, including wall, 
curtain wall, floor, ceiling, roof, column, beam, lift, window, door, and opening, in a way suitable for 
3D building semantic reconstruction. This yielded 49,380 object instances. 

Compared to existing building datasets, our HBD dataset stands out by offering significant advantages: 
it encompasses more object types essential to building reconstruction, 
includes a larger number of object instances, 
covers both interior and exterior scenes, and features annotations tailored for 3D building reconstruction. 

Furthermore, we tested and compared five typical DL-based instance segmentation models on the dataset. 
The findings affirm the datasetâ€™s convenience for researchers and practitioners to train and test relevant instance 
segmentation models. The benchmark results can also provide a valuable guide for users to select proper algorithms 
for their own applications based on the accuracy and training and inference costs.

The dataset is open to the public and can be downloaded from: https://uofmacau-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/mowong_um_edu_mo/Evfm1vtv4xRBoZ61r7VaSpoBSPO2GKDUd9x5xDY9WqXKCw?e=OGxv19
